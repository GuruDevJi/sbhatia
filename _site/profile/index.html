            <p>Curiosity has driven my journey from the start. I grew up taking hardware and software apart just to see how they worked, which shaped me into a creative, systems-oriented problem solver with a relentless taste for experimentation.</p>
            <p>One project felt like unlocking a cheat code in a video game: building a capacitive touch panel controller entirely from scratch. Using a PIC18F microcontroller, I wrote every line of firmware to drive the FocalTech FT5X06 chip, bringing multi-touch gestures to life on a 4.3" Newhaven TFT display. Watching my code respond instantly to finger swipes was pure exhilaration—like beating a boss level after weeks of grinding.</p>
            <p>That same thrill carried me into enterprise systems, where I built VB.NET applications to track RMAs at a manufacturing firm in Elgin, IL, opening the door to financial platforms and business processes. Since then, I've mastered how data, workflows, and people intersect across complex organizations.</p>
            <p>My focus has since expanded—bridging functional needs, technical architecture, and user experience with AI, machine learning, and intelligent automation. Today, I'm chasing that same video game rush: creating financial and operational systems that are efficient, intuitive, resilient, and genuinely inspiring to use.</p>
