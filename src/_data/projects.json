    "details": "<strong>Technology as an Enabler:</strong> My first personal portfolio website took several months to build and had a very basic, dated appearance, with limited features and little interactivity. In contrast, this current site was developed in just two days, thanks to modern tools and frameworks. Leveraging Eleventy, Nunjucks, and custom JavaScript, I was able to quickly implement a much more engaging and interactive experience.<br><br><strong>AI Vibe Coding:</strong> I used AI-powered vibe coding to develop this website, despite having minimal prior knowledge of JavaScript. This approach enabled rapid prototyping, troubleshooting, and feature implementation, making the development process highly efficient and accessible.<br><br><strong>Features:</strong> The site now includes a dynamic blog page, interactive map, embedded videos, a contact form powered by Formspree, and a responsive UI with sticky sidebar navigation and collapsible panels. These enhancements were made possible by the rapid evolution of web technologies, which have dramatically reduced development time and enabled richer user experiences.<br><br><strong>Tools Used:</strong> VS Code, Git, GitHub, Eleventy (11ty), Nunjucks, Formspree, custom CSS/JS.<br><br><strong>Architecture:</strong> Static site generated with Eleventy, modular Nunjucks templates, global JSON data for content, assets pipeline for CSS/JS/images, deployed via GitHub Pages.<br><br><strong>Why:</strong> I built this site to have full control over design, content, and workflow, using modern tools and best practices for maintainability and speed.<br><ul style='margin:0.5em 0 0.5em 1.5em;'><li>Set up a Cloudflare Worker as a serverless proxy to deliver leadership quotes to my website. Configured the Worker to include the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header in its responses, enabling secure cross-origin requests and fully resolving browser CORS issues for dynamic quote delivery.</li></ul>"
