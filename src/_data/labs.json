    "brief": "A custom-coded personal portfolio site built from scratch to showcase my work, experience, and contact info.",
    "details": "<strong>Technology as an Enabler:</strong> My first personal portfolio website took several months to build and had a very basic, dated appearance, with limited features and little interactivity. In contrast, this current site was developed in just two days, thanks to modern tools and frameworks. Leveraging Eleventy, Nunjucks, and custom JavaScript, I was able to quickly implement a much more engaging and interactive experience.<br><br><strong>AI Vibe Coding:</strong> I used AI-powered vibe coding to develop this website, despite having minimal prior knowledge of JavaScript. This approach enabled rapid prototyping, troubleshooting, and feature implementation, making the development process highly efficient and accessible.<br><br><strong>Features & Technical Aspects:</strong> The site now includes a dynamic blog page, interactive map, embedded videos, a contact form powered by Formspree, and a responsive UI with sticky sidebar navigation and collapsible panels. These enhancements were made possible by the rapid evolution of web technologies, which have dramatically reduced development time and enabled richer user experiences.<br><br><strong>Unique Implementation Details (Most to Least Complex):</strong><ul style='margin:0.5em 0 0.5em 1.5em;'><li><strong>Cloudflare Worker Integration:</strong> Serverless proxy for fetching leadership quotes with CORS handling for secure cross-origin requests.</li><li><strong>Matrix Rain Background Animation:</strong> Canvas-based animated background using requestAnimationFrame for the Labs page with falling characters and opacity fade effects.</li><li><strong>Sticky Sidebar Navigation:</strong> Sidebar that remains fixed in viewport while scrolling, with automatic active link highlighting based on scroll position and JavaScript scroll event detection.</li><li><strong>Collapsible Details Drawer:</strong> Expandable project cards with smooth animations that dynamically reposition based on grid layout, using CSS transitions and JavaScript event handling.</li><li><strong>Dynamic Event Listeners:</strong> Vanilla JavaScript for menu toggling, tab switching, scroll detection, and DOM manipulation across multiple pages.</li><li><strong>JSON-Driven Content Architecture:</strong> All project, experience, education, and specialization data loaded from JSON files, enabling easy updates without template changes.</li><li><strong>Tabbed Interface:</strong> Multi-tab content panels with animated fade-in transitions, active state indicators, and keyboard-accessible tab management.</li><li><strong>Responsive Grid Layout:</strong> CSS Grid with auto-fit and minmax for flexible multi-column layouts that adapt to screen size.</li><li><strong>Form Integration:</strong> Formspree-powered contact form with client-side validation and server-side email delivery.</li><li><strong>Custom SVG Navigation Icons:</strong> Inline SVG icons for navigation links with drop-shadow filters and dynamic color coding per page section.</li><li><strong>Glowing Text Effects:</strong> Accent colors with text-shadow glow effects on hover (gold, blue, cyan, pink, orange, purple) for visual emphasis and feedback.</li></ul><br><strong>Tools Used:</strong> VS Code, Git, GitHub, Eleventy (11ty), Nunjucks, Formspree, Cloudflare Workers, custom CSS/JS.<br><br><strong>Architecture:</strong> Static site generated with Eleventy, modular Nunjucks templates, global JSON data for content, assets pipeline for CSS/JS/images, deployed via GitHub Pages.<br><br><strong>Why:</strong> I built this site to have full control over design, content, and workflow, using modern tools and best practices for maintainability and speed."
